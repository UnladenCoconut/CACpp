# CACpp
## Hello There.

### Build guide:
Use build.bat or debug.bat for release and debug builds respectively.

### Debugging with Visual Studio
First run debug.bat.
Goto solutions explorer, right click CAC.exe, then select 'set as startup item'. (You may have to use 'Show all files' at the top of solution explorer.)  
Then add your breakpoints to the code files and run.
